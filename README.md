# Web 3 To-List Learning Project
- This project was my first attempt to develop a webapp using Web3 technologies.
- This project deploys a smart contract found in **/contracts/ToDo.sol** to the Alchemy Goerli test network
- The frontend is built in react and connects to the contract using **ethers**
